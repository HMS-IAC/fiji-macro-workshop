Welcome to Introduction to Macro writing in ImageJ/Fiji!
=========================================================

This set of slides was developed for an in-person workshop taught at Harvard Medical School.

The slides introduce participants to key concepts in writing macros in ImageJ/Fiji, offering practical insights for biologists interested in automating image analysis workflows.

The workshop is **tailored for beginners** with no prior programming experience. It combines tutorials and hands-on exercises to ensure an engaging and accessible learning experience.

The session begins with a general introduction to programming concepts (e.g., variables, arrays, for loops, if/else statements) and gradually builds toward creating a complete Fiji macro through a step-by-step process.

If you are a `Fiji/ImageJ <https://fiji.sc>`_ beginner and are intersted to learn more, you can follow this `Introduction to Bioimage Analysis using ImageJ/Fiji workshop <https://hms-iac.github.io/fiji-workshop/versions/2025_01_22/index.html>`_.

Finally, we will record and build a `step-by-step macro to segment nuclei <_static/fiji_macros.zip>`_ following a classical image processing workflow. This macro will **automate the pipeline**, enabling it to **process all the images in a specified folder**.
